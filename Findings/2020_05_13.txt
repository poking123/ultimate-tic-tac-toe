We found before that the algorithm was no good when we looked at one branch (the first one) and only looked in that branch, not looking at other branches (of course).

What I found interesting today was that increasing the amount of iterations of MCST actually made the algorithm worse. I think the reason is that having more iterations decreases the value of the function. 
In this case, we have to decrease the value of each exploreValue iteration (change the coefficient). Is there a way to tune the parameter to maximize it? Then we also have to optimize the number of iterations.

2000 > 20000
500 > 2000
500 > 250
