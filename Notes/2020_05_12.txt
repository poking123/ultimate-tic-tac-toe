How about we run an iteration like 10 times on a new branch instead of just once?


It looks to me that the algorithm isn't searching enough branches The more we search in one branch, the more we continue to search down that branch.
1987/2000 iterations gone done only 1 child branch from the root node.


Why does which player matter? We're always trying to go down the optimal path.


Here's an idea, tune the parameters to make the algorithm it's strongest
